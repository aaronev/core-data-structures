# Core Data Structures

## Specifications

### Day 1
- [x] A working implementation of the `Node` data structure is complete.
- [x] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Node`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Linked List` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Linked List`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Stack` data structure is complete.

### Day 2
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Stack`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Queue` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Queue`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Priority Queue` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Priority Queue`.

### Day 3
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Priority Node` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Priority Node`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Doubly-Linked List` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Doubly-Linked List`.

## Day 4
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Double Node` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Double Node`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Set` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Set`.

### Day 5
- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [core-data-structures][core-data-structures] repo.
- [ ] Can run all tests with `npm test`.
- [ ] All tests are passing.

### Stretch

Pick a _different_ programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Java...) and write tests & implementations for each.

- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
- [ ] For each data structure identified above, there exists:
  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property _in a language other than JavaScript_.
  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure _in a language other than JavaScript_.
